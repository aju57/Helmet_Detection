# Helmet_Detection
 This repository contains a custom-trained YOLOv8 model designed to detect whether bike riders are wearing helmets. The model was trained using a dataset of images labeled with two classes: helmet and no_helmet.  Overview The primary objective of this project is to enhance road safety by automating the detection of helmet usage among bike riders. The model can be integrated into various applications, including traffic monitoring systems, safety compliance checks, and more.
